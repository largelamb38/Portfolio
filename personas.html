                    <p>The interface on the left is a vending machine located in the Scili. Vending machines provide users with a convenient way to buy snacks in a quick exchange without human interaction. 
                        The goal of this project is to conduct research on this interface through observations and user interviews. Then, I will create two empathy maps and
                        a storyboard which will present my findings and common issues found when users interact with this interface

                        <h2>Research/Feedback</h2> <br>
                        <h3>Problems I've Observed</h3>
                        <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Users are unsure which side of their card to swipe with and often end up swiping both sides</li>
                            <li>In half the observations, after swiping their Brown ID on the correct side, users need to swipe 
                                another time as the card reader failed to either detect that there was a swipe or authenticate their swipe</li>
                            <li>The card reader almost always failed to authenticate the first swipe if users wanted to get a second snack. 
                                Users are visibility frustrated, often give up, and leave with just one snack</li>
                        </ol> <br>
            
                        <h3>These were the questions I asked my interviwees:</h3>
                        <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Did the vending machine work exactly how you would expect one work?</li>
                            <li>Do you experience any issues when you swipe your card? Does the card reader consistently work?</li>
                            <li>Was there anything you would suggest to improve user experience?</li>
                            <li>How would you comment on the efficiency of this system?</li>
                            <li>How does your experience with the vending machine compare with that of convenience stores (e.g. Metro Mart, 7/11, Gourmet to Go, etc.) and your previous experience with vending machines?</li>
                        </ol>
                            <h3>Observations:</h3> <br>
                        <ol>
                                <li>Generally, users with previous experience with vending machines stated that it was rather easy learning the process of how vending machines worked 
                                    although users highlighted that they are unsure of which side of the card to swipe on even though there was a sign, which was confusing</li>
                                <li>Users complained that the vending machine took too much time to process the card swipe and had lengthy wait times before they could select a snack.
                                     Also, multiple users noted that their first swipe was not authenticated and required a second or even third swipe to go through.</li>
                                <li>There was common sentiment among all users that the card swipe process was too lengthy and needed to become more efficient and accurate. 
                                    They want to only swipe once and be immediately able to select a snack.</li>
                                <li>Users wanted a feature to buy multiple snacks with one swipe. The process of swiping multiple times for multiple snacks was inefficient. 
                                    Moreover, card swipes were never authenticated on the first try after having bought a snack.</li>
                                <li>Users favored vending machines over kiosks machines as the human-less interaction nature matched their needs for efficiency; 
                                    however, in comparison to other vending machines, users were frustrated with the card swiping system (lengthy time to authenticate 
                                    a swipe, inability to consistently register swipes on their first time, and inability to swipe consecutively)</li>

                                    Ariana Stephan is a senior at Brown trying to juggle the stresses of full-time recruiting, 
                                    the wrath of finals season, and her responsibilties on the club ski team.

                                    Her social anxiety makes using vending machines difficult as the card reader failing to recognize 
                                    and authenticate her Brown ID adds to the pressure she gets from the line.

                                    Ariana’s persona represents the chosen interface as she embodies the profile of many students in 
                                    the Scili: ambitious, busy, and a little bit socially anxious.</p>

                                    Noah faces problems using the Scili vending machine as he is extremely impatient and hungry so the interface’s long processing times and authentication problems frustrate him.

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3> <br> <br>
                    <p> I think that the interface of the Scili vending machine does make the process of obtaining snacks much easier. 
                        Users no longer need to walk to a store and go to a cashier. However, I think that there are many issues with the interface
                        to make the process much easier. There must be a more clear sign to instruct users with which side to swipe with.
                        Also, there must be a way for users to buy multiple snacks with only one swipe. </p>
