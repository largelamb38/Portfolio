		<p>Developing an interactive interface and functioning e-commerce website with React.js</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>For this project, I attempted to use React.js to build an interactive interface for an online tennis shop 
                            called "Providence Classic Tennis Shop". The focus of this website was on functionality. My goal was to have
                            a functioning aggregator section, a sorting feature, and two filtering categories. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class = "problems">
                        <h2>Design Iterations</h2> <br>
                            <p>As this is an ecommerce website, I chose to have my aggregator act as a cart to keep track of the quantity and price of items 
                                users bought as well as the total cart price. My filters will filter items based on brand and item category. The sorting feature
                            will be based off of price (high to low or low to high) as I think this is the most useful functionality for customers. I think that
                            these choices are standard for ecommerce websites. Nevertheless, they are most catered to online shopping since customers want to 
                            see the price of their cart and filter based on their needs.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3> <br>
                    <p> This project really taught me a lot in designing the functionality of a website. I had my first stab at making a fully functioning website
                        as I learned about how to use React.js and its states. <br>
